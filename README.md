# Modes

StarArmory can add modded items in two different ways:

Additive support allowing merges with vanilla/other mods, meaning a larger range of things will spawn. Useful for diverse crowds or nameless enemies.

Vanilla removal mode, allowing only selected modded content to spawn. Useful for forcing companions to wear certain outfits.
